# SHC_project
Repository for the project in the course: Sustainable Heating &amp; Cooling Technologies at ETH. This project's aim is to develop a heat pump system for a pasta cooker related to a student project. The used libraries were introduced in the lecture except for two (but both not directly relevant for the heat pump design). To run the file **`Worst_case_power`** the optimizer **Gurobi** is required as it is our prefered optimizer and we wanted to get an idea of the problem as fast as possible (**Gurobi** with very low runtime).
